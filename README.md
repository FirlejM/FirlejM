# About me
My name is Mariusz. I'm firefighter in Municipality State Fire Service. I work shifts, 24 hours on duty and 48 hours off. My current job is rescuing but most of my time is waiting to be dispatched. I am interested in new technologies and solutions. I like mental work and creating solutions. For this reason, I would like to develop my acquired skills in software testing. I can test software full time, 120 hours in office, 48 hours remotely.
